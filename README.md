The project consists of building a blood sugar tracking application for diabetic patients. It models the current pen and paper template that is popularly used to track blood sugar levels and insulin intake, and we believe that the transition from paper to technology allows for easier tracking and analysis of this data.

The data collected consists of:
- Date (DD MMM YYYY)
- Time (HH:MM)
- Current Blood Sugar levels ()
- Insulin intake (in units)
- Carbohydrate intake (in grams)
- Comments (to record any user remarks)
